# Library-Management-System-using-DSA-Concept
📚 Library Management System

A Python-based Library Management System that applies Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) concepts to manage both physical books and ebooks efficiently. It provides operations like adding, removing, searching, and viewing resources with file persistence for long-term storage.

✨ Features

📖 Book Management – add, remove, search, and view available books

💻 Ebook Management – manage ebooks with title, author, and format

🔍 Search Functionality – search by title, author, ISBN, or format

🗂 Data Persistence – load and save data from external files

🧭 Menu-Driven Interface – interactive and user-friendly navigation

🛠 Data Structures & Algorithms Used

Linked List – manages book collection for efficient search/retrieval

Stack – organizes ebook collection (LIFO principle)

Queue – tracks available books for borrowing (FIFO principle)

Array (Python List) – stores available ebooks for quick access

Search Algorithms – traversal and matching in linked lists, stacks, and arrays

📌 DSA Focus

This project emphasizes core DSA concepts by demonstrating:

Application of different data structures for specific use-cases

Efficient storage, retrieval, and search operations

Real-world problem-solving using algorithmic approaches

🚀 Future Enhancements

Add user accounts and reservation system

Advanced reporting & analytics

GUI-based interface for better usability

📖 Conclusion

The project demonstrates how DSA concepts can be applied to real-world systems like a library. It ensures efficiency, scalability, and accuracy in managing resources while laying the foundation for advanced development.
